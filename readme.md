## Summary of Findings
In this study, I will try to provide the necessary visualizations between some interesting variables to see their effect on other variables such as Trip duration.
This dataset is from the Ford GoBike System (bike rental company) dataset, this dataset contains  519700 rows and 13 columns
The data processing for this dataset consisted of transforming the data files, merging the 12 month datasets into 1 year dataset, and removing a few unnecessary columns that would not be used in data analysis. But i leave all columns. 
I started my analysis by looking at the structure of the dataset.The main area of interest was what are the factors influencing the trip duration. I have performed univariate exploration, bi-variate exploration and multi-variate exploration
## Key Insights for Presentation

The difference in trip duration in all aspects: days, months and hours

The customer trip duration is longer than the average of the subscriber

Looking at the visualization, the subscriber is much less active than the customer, which surprised me

All columns are interconnected, according to the examples that I have considered
